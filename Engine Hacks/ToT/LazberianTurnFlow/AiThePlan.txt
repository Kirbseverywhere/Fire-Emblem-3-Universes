how AI works right now, rough algorithm:
	aiUnits = all_units[allegiance]
	sort_ai_units(aiUnits) // how it does that doesn't matter

	foreach unit in aiUnits:
		try_heal_or_escape(unit)
		try_exec_ai1(unit)
		try_exec_ai2(unit)
		try_use_special_item(unit) // door key, lockpick, antidote

Doesn't quite exist in the form of a function but that's about how it does decition making on the whole

THE PLAN:
	aiUnits = all_units[allegiance]
	// Do not sort

	foreach unit in aiUnits:
		try_exec_ai1(unit)

	foreach unit in aiUnits:
		try_heal_or_escape(unit)

	foreach unit in aiUnits:
		try_use_special_item(unit)

	foreach unit in aiUnits:
		try_exec_ai2(unit)
