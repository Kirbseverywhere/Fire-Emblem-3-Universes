## PJ1Narration
The Kingdom of Seraphyn. Ruled by[N]
the von Siegfried family for[AN]
centuries, the Kingdom has enjoyed[N]
an era of peace and prosperity.[AN]
However, recent events have[N]
roused up disdain among the people.[AN]
To the west, the Novingale Empire[N]
has been conducting frequent border[AN]
skirmishes, deploying numerous[N]
troops to that region, but Seraphyn's[AN]
current monarch, King Curtis, has[N]
done little to address Novingale's[AN]
aggression. Under pressure from his[N]
advisors, Curtis has requested an[AN]
audience with Aurea, current sovereign[N]
of Novingale. He brings along his son,[AN]
Prince Vergil, hoping that the[N]
experience will help educate him on[AN]
negotiating with other countries...[A][X]

#Horus:
[Left]
Prince Vergil, how are you[N]
faring? It must be exhausting,[AN]
having to travel all the way[N]
to Highwater Bridge.[A]


#Vergil:
[MR]
It's alright, Horus. You need[N]
not worry about me. I can manage[AN]
for the rest of the trip.[A]

#Daff:
[FL]
Still, you look weary, milord.[N]
I probably don't have to remind[AN]
you that you should take it[N]
easy every now and then, but...[A]

#Vergil:
[MR]
Well, I would be lying if I said[N]
I wasn't half nervous. It's nothing[AN]
I can't manage, however.[A]

#Daff:
[FL]
Oh, um... If you say so, I'll try[N]
to take your word for it. I-I...[AN]
think I ought to go and check on[N]
the others, too.[A]

#*Daff leaves*
[Clear]

#Horus:
[Left]
Still, Daff has a point, Lord Vergil -[N]
you must take care of your health.[AN]
You have an important role in the[N]
new trade agreement with Novingale,[AN]
yes? We have to make sure that you're-[A]

GOOD LUCK LATER, VERGIL! I KNOW[N]
YOU CAN DO IT- I, uh... mean...[AN]
Prince Vergil...? ...Milord?[A]

#Horus:
[Right]
Ahem. If Tray's here, Sme should[N]
be coming any second now...[A]

#*Sme enters*
[FL][LoadSmeglinde]
#Sme:
Tray! Get back here this instant![N]
How many times have I told you[AN]
to behave appropriately in front[N]
of the Prince?[A]

#Tray:
[Left]
Umm... I'm... sorry?[A]

#Vergil:
[FarRight]
Hah - you don't have to be such a[N]
stick in the mud, Smeglinde. The[AN]
Kingdom isn't in its best state at[N]
the moment. Tray's enthusiasm and[AN]
positivity is much needed in such[N]
trying times. You have my thanks.[A]

#Sme:
[FarLeft]
But still, I think all of us would[N]
rather have our ears working after[AN]
this long excursion.[A]

#Tray:
[Left]
I'm still confused, Vergil- I mean,[N]
Prince Vergil. Why are you with us,[AN]
instead of your family?[A]

#Vergil:
[FR]
I would rather be here, Tray. My[N]
parents are a stern lot - being[AN]
around them wouldn't be too[N]
healthy for me. And besides,[AN]
Orion's there with your brothers.[N]
They're the most loyal of men we have.[AN]

#Tray:
[Left]
Oh, right, my big brothers! One day,[N]
I'll be just like them, and stand[AN]
by your side as a royal knight![A]

#Vergil:
[FR]
Well, I'm sure you will, Tray. I can[N]
tell you have the same zeal as them.[A]

Ooh! I can see Highwater Bridge![N]
Oh, the bridge brings back[AN]
good memories. I remember when[N]
I was young, I-[A]

the sudden stop?[A]

Do not get ahead of yourself,[N]
Sir Yanndahl. Now, if you[AN]
would, send your men to cut[N]

than capable of holding off[AN]
the other side.[A]

[ML]#Yanndahl:
...Hmph. Your units better not[N]
hold us back, girl. Besides,[AN]
shouldn't they be focusing[N]
on the royal caravan?[AN]

[MR]#Runa:
Don't worry about that.[N]
We'll carry out this[AN]

Now, you'd better pick[AN]

it involves getting your[N]

aim for the commander leading[AN]
