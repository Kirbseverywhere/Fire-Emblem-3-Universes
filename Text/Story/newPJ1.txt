## PJ1OpeningNarration
The Kingdom of Seraphyn, ruled by[N]
the scions of House Siegfried for ages.[A][N]
Though the Kingdom has enjoyed an era of peace,[N]
tensions have been brewing lately.[A][N]
Rumours have spread claiming that the[N]
Novingale Empire has been conducting[N]
frequent skirmishes at Seraphyn's borders.[A][N]
Seraphyn's monarch, [....]King Curtis,[....][N] 
has done little to address the rumours,[N]
but his son, [....]Prince Vergil,[....][N]
remains suspicious and wary.[A][N]
Accompanied by his retainers,[N]
[....]the Purple Jaguars,[....][N]
Vergil sets off to Artasia,[N]
[....]a border settlement,[....][N]
to inspect these claims[Beat][A][X]


## PJ1OpeningScene1
# The Sacred Throne, Castronda (PJ-7 map)
# *Several nobles leave the throne room and gather outside. Vergil follows behind them.*
[OpenMidRight][LoadVergil]#Vergil
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]

[OpenFarFarLeft]#Noble (all the nobles have text bubbles floating around mid-air?): 
It's absurd, isn't it?[A][N]
Our borders are threatened,[N]
and His Majesty does nothing?[A]

[CloseSpeechSlow]
Nobody can confirm the truth[N]
behind those rumours, though.[A][N]
If it's all a hoax,[A][N]
we'll be wasting resources[N]
reinforcing the area.[A]

[CloseSpeechSlow]
Bah, he's gone[N]
senile in his old age.[A][N]
It's pitiful, really.[A]

[CloseSpeechSlow]
Do you think Siegfried's[N]
Curse is getting to him?[A][N]
His Majesty looks[Beat] [.....]sickly.[A]

[CloseSpeechSlow]
How dare you spout such vile words[N]
in the Sacred Throne, you snake?![A]

[OpenFarFarRight]#Noble (off-screen, far right)
Who are you calling a snake?[A][N]
We want the country to prosper too,[N]
you simple-minded patriot![A]

[OpenMidRight]#Vergil
[Beat][A][N][OpenEyes] 
If you would excuse me, my lords.[A][N]
I'm afraid I must take my leave now.[A][N]
Have a good day, gentlemen.[A][X]

#Vergil
[Beat]Horus.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]#Horus
Ah, milord.[A][N]
Whatever seems to[N]
be bothering you?[A]

[OpenMidRight]#Vergil
I[Beat] I don't get Father's words.[A][N]
Why won't he ramp up[N]
security at the borders,[A][N]
even with all the talk[N]
about Novingale's attacks?[A][N]
He must be insane to just[N]
ignore all these issues![A]

[OpenMidLeft]#Horus
Forgive me, milord.[A][N]
I perceive His Majesty as[N]
being[Beat] overly cautious.[A]

[OpenMidRight]#Vergil
Please elaborate, Horus.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]#Horus
His Majesty doesn't want to risk[N]
any conflicts against Novingale.[A][N]
He could send a battalion[N]
to defend the border,[A][N]
but I think he really doesn't[N]
want to invoke their wrath.[A][N]
It's either cautiousness[Beat] or fear.[A]

[OpenMidRight]#Vergil
Hmm[Beat][A][N]
Father's gone meek[N]
in his old age.[A][N]
Disappointing.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]#Horus
I wouldn't be so critical, Lord Vergil.[A][N]
None of us know what[N]
Novingale is planning.[A][N]
Just a few months ago,[A][N]
Novingale terminated all contact[N]
with us without any explanation.[A][N]
His Majesty sent a messenger to[N]
relay our concerns five days ago,[A][N]
but he never returned.[A][N]
And with the border attacks,[N]
it's all very[Beat] concerning.[A]

[OpenMidRight]#Vergil
But still, father's letting[N]
them get away with all this?[A][N]
It's outrageous.[A][N]
[......] 
Horus, inform Tray and Khris[N]
to be ready this evening.[A][N]
We'll embark for the border forts,[N]
regardless of the circumstances.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]#Horus
What?[A][N]
I have no objections, [....]Lord Vergil,[....][N]
but if His Majesty knows of this[Beat][A]

[OpenMidRight]#Vergil
I know the consequences, Horus.[A][N]
But I simply can't let this slide.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]#Horus
[Beat]Very well, Lord Vergil.[A][N]
I'll arrange it with due haste.[A][X]

Cut me some slack, Tray.[A][N]
We've been in this[N]

I appreciate any time for resting[N]

[OpenRight]#Tray:
Well, we're nearly there![A][N]
Horus says we'll be at Artasia soon![A]

[OpenMidLeft]#Khris:
Forgive me for asking, Lord Vergil.[A][N]
Why are we being this secretive?[A][N]
I thought we were just[N]
going to inspect the area?[A]

[OpenFarRight]#Vergil:
Father would definitely prevent[N]
us from leaving the capital.[A][N]
We didn't have much of a choice.[A]

[OpenRight]#Tray:
Hey, in the meantime,[N]
we get to enjoy the scenery![A][N]
Just breathe in the[N]

[ToggleSmile]Ahh, it brings[N]

This is an order, Konatsu![N]
You have no time to waste![A][N]
Leave it to me and the rest[N]
of my men to hold them off![A]

[OpenRight]#Horus
Tray[Beat][A][N]
we're certain that Novingale[N]

[OpenFarLeft]#Konatsu
[Beat]What?![N]
How could that be?[A]

[OpenFarRight]#Vergil
I know it sounds nonsensical, but[Beat][A][N]
the invaders used Seraphyn[N]
tactics and battle formations.[A][N]
It's why their fighting style[N]
seemed so[Beat] uncanny.[A]

[OpenRight]#Horus
Their choice of target[N]
made no sense as well.[A][N]
A small group of soldiers[N]
attacking one border fort?[A][N]
Amidst the confusion and chaos,[A][N]
they had all the time in the[N]
world to raid the nearby villages.[A]

Now that I think about it,[A][N]
it looked like they completely[N]
ignored the villages[Beat][A][N]
like they wanted a show of force.[A]

The only possibility is that[Beat][N]
those soldiers were ours.[A][N]
The "Novingale strike force"[N]
was a group of Seraphyn soldiers.[A]

Wait, so all the reports[N]

were they all[Beat][N]
planned by Seraphyn herself?[A]

[OpenRight]#Horus
[....]We aren't certain.[A][N]
But with the evidence laid out,[N]
it's a possibility.[A]

But why would Seraphyn[N]
want to destroy herself[Beat]?[A][N]
Our own soldiers killing each other?[A][N]
Who would willingly follow[N]
such vile orders?[A]

[OpenFarRight]#Vergil
Like Horus said, we aren't sure yet.[A][N]
There's no way the Senate[N]
