## RL3OpeningNarration
Having slain Alva and liberated the[N]
late count's lands, Rodin has[AN]
amassed support from the populace.[N]
Deciding to stay home at Argalia[AN]
Palace, Rodin pursues his own[N]
agenda by planning his next move.[AN]
However, wild shrieks from the[N]
heavens say otherwise, as northern[AN]
Novingale budges under the might[N]
of migrating wyverns...[A][X]

[MR]#Rodin:
...Mother.[N]
[ML]#Aurea:
Oh, my dear boy. It warms my heart to see[N]
you back home unharmed, my child.[AN]
[MR]#Rodin:
Cease the pleasantries,[N]
wretch. You know you[AN]
wouldn't have minded had[N]
Alva slit my throat.[AN]
[ML]#Aurea:
Pardon?[AN]
[MR]#Rodin:
Do not take me for a fool, Mother.[N]
I thought you wiser than that.[AN]
[ML]#Aurea:
Mind your manners, young man. Know[N]
to whom it is that you speak.[AN]
[MR]#Rodin:
Tch. Stating the obvious is the[N]
fool's hallmark. Now, any other[AN]
drivel you should bother me with?[AN]
[ML]#Aurea:
Why, you little...![AN]
[MR]#Rodin:
Do not bar my path, Mother.[N]
Your blatherings and visage[AN]
plague me both.[AN]
[ML]#Aurea:
You have no grasp of what I intend[N]
to accomplish for our nation, Rodin.[AN]
If only you understood... then this[N]
would all be so much easier.[AN]
[MR]#Rodin:
I know well enough what[N]
it is you desire.[AN]
[ML]#Aurea:
Then why do you continue to oppose[N]
me when our goals align? Why must[AN]
you always make things so damned[N]
difficult for me?[AN]
[MR]#Rodin:
You turn a blind eye to the[N]
destitute. I will never serve[AN]
anyone with such despicable[N]
views. Now begone.[AN]
[ML]#Aurea:
Despicable-[AN]

Calling me despicable, yet[AN]
shoving his own mother aside...[A][X]

[MR]#Cleo (R):
Hey, Rodin? Looks like something[N]
happened. I can tell.[AN]
[ML]#Rodin (L):
Hm? Oh, pay me no heed, Cleo.[N]
It is nothing important.[AN]
[MR]#Cleo:
Well, your furrowed brow [N]
says otherwise. Tell me,[AN]
what's going on?[AN]
[ML]#Rodin:
You see right through me,[N]
don't you? Well, I crossed[AN]
paths with my mother. That[N]
should speak for itself.[AN]
[MR]#Cleo:
Yeah, I see now... Mind telling[N]
me what happened this time?[AN]
[ML]#Rodin:
She approached me with false[N]
pleasantries, which was irritating[AN]
enough. When I put her in her[N]
place, she reacted with even more[AN]
vitriol and claimed I was ignorant.[AN]
[MR]#Cleo:
I think I know where things are[N]
going next. She lamented that[AN]
you were working against her,[N]
didn't she?[AN]
[ML]#Rodin:
Yes, exactly. It has been the same[N]
song and dance for years.[AN]
[MR]#Cleo:
You know, I'm glad I can say all[N]
of this to you where nobody else[AN]
can hear me. Even then, who knows[N]
if one of the Empress's spies is[AN]
concealing themselves here...[AN]
[ML]#Rodin:
You can never rest easy around that[N]
woman, unless you happen to be part[AN]
of her inner circle. Pardon me, her[N]
pathetic little clique of bootlickers.[AN]
[MR]#Cleo:
Uh, you okay, Rodin?[AN]
[ML]#Rodin:
Ugh... I apologize, my[N]
friend. You did not need[AN]
to be subjected to those[N]
ramblings.[AN]
[MR]#Cleo:
Hey, don't worry about it.[N]
You're the reason I can even[AN]
tolerate noble life at all.[A]

#Soldier (L):
My Prince! Migrating wyverns[N]
have been reported near the[AN]
village of Rietveld![AN]
[Right]#Rodin (R):
Tell me, are they targeting[N]
the village itself?[AN]
[ML]#Soldier:
Yes, milord. The people are in a[N]
panic, but not everyone's houses[AN]
will hold at this rate. What are[N]
your orders, Sire?[AN]
[Right]#Rodin:
You know what comes next, Cleo.[AN]
[FR]#Cleo:
Yeah. We'll make sure Rietveld[N]
is secured from the wyvern[AN]
migration! No time to lose, Rodin![AN]

We ride![A][X]

We've arrived. That at least[N]
went somewhat smoothly...[AN]
#(insert wyvern screech if possible)[N]
[Right]#Mimi (R):
Ooh, are those wyverns I hear?[N]
Do you hear them, Rodin?[AN]
[Left]#Rodin:
Loud and clear. Normally, it is[N]
a fool's errand to interrupt[AN]
a wyvern migration, much less[N]
strike during one.[AN]
[Right]#Mimi:
Doesn't sound like you've[N]
got much of a choice.[AN]
[Left]#Rodin:
Precisely. We must protect[N]
Rietveld before the wyverns[AN]
can claim any lives here.[AN]
[FR][LoadMichael][FL][LoadEric]
[FR]#Michael (R):
Your orders, milord?[AN]
[Left]#Rodin:
Defend the villages from any[N]
attacking wyverns. Subdue[AN]

You've heard the Boss.[N]

Sir Innards, you are wearing[N]
a particular grimace.[A]
[ML]#Innards:
These wyverns seem[N]
like fine sport.[A]
[MR]#Michael:
I've noticed you indulge yourself[N]
in the thrill of battle. Am I[AN]
right in presuming so?[A]
[ML]#Innards:
Yes.[A]
[MR]#Michael:
Hmm... That look in your eyes tells[N]
me battle is more than that to you.[AN]
I won't pry, however.[A]
[ML]#Innards:
Battle is what keeps me going.[N]
It keeps me alive.[A]
[MR]#Michael:
I fight for my liege and my country.[N]
You have an equally valid reason[AN]
to brandish your sword. All that[N]
being said, may I continue to count[AN]
on you, Sir Innards?[AN]
[ML]#Innards:
I guess.[A]

Thank you. Now, let us away![A]

Hm? Oh, hello there. Are you [N]
also here to subdue the wyvern threat?[A]

Yes.[A]

What a nice coincidence.[N]
I was just about to[AN]
engage those reptiles myself.[A]
[MR]#current
What's your name?[A]

My name's Lenato. I believe you[N]

Hm? Ah, you must be Prince Rodin.[N]
To what do I owe you the honors?[AN]

No honor in particular. I am[N]
simply here to protect my[AN]
citizens from wyvern aggression.[A]
[ML]#Lenato:
How quaint. It seems we've[N]
got the same goal, then.[AN]

Would you be willing to offer[N]

Sure. My name is Lenato,[N]

Lord Rodin, we have captured[N]

[ML]#Rodin:
Thank you, Michael.[A]
[Right]#Michael:
If you do not mind me asking,[N]
milord, why did you order[AN]
for the wyvern to be captured[N]
and not killed?[A]
[ML]#Rodin:
Long have I dreamt of taking to[N]
the skies astride a wyvern.[AN]
I know this request of mine was[N]
very selfish, so I apologize[AN]
for making you heed my[N]
self-indulgence.[A]
[Right]#Michael:
Not a problem at all, my liege.[N]
Come to think of it, did your[AN]
distant ancestor not fight[N]
astride a wyvern as well?[AN]
[ML]#Rodin:
That he did. My venerable ancestor,[N]
Gildias Novingale, was seldom seen[AN]
without his trusted wyvern companion,[N]
Altair. I could go into more details,[AN]
