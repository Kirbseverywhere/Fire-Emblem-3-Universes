## RL1Narration
The Novingale Empire.[N]
A proud and well-faring nation[AN]
that has thrived for centuries.[N]
In recent years, the nation has[AN]
reached a peak of welfare, and[N]
its population has begun[AN]
exploding ever since. However,[N]
the increasing population[AN]
demands more space. The cities of[N]
Novingale are being overrun,[AN]
and disease has started to crop up[N]
over a lack of organization[AN]
and proper measures.[N]
Empress Aurea, current sovereign[AN]
of Novingale, seems to be[N]
turning the commonfolk's[AN]
suffering a blind eye. Her son,[N]
Crown Prince Rodin, has taken[AN]
up arms to protect the commonfolk.[N]
Now, his duty takes him to the[AN]
territory of Count Alva, a[N]
decadent noble notorious for[AN]
leeching off his people...[A][X]

'Tis a tragedy, it is...[A]

The least thing we say about it,[N]
he'll flog us, too. Now let's[AN]
hope nobody's heard us...[A]
[MidLeft]
What's it matter? We're already[N]
doomed to bite it. The scythe o'[AN]
hunger will be takin' us 'fore long.[A]

[MidRight][LoadRodin]
[Left]# Eric
Is this the[N]
place, Boss?[A]
[MidRight]# Rodin
Yes. Alva territory is[N]
right around these[AN]
parts. Just a little[N]
further.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadKelly]
Milord, would you remind us[N]
what we've come to do here?[A]
[MidRight]#Rodin
We're here because we've been[N]
receiving complaints from the[AN]
townsfolk of Alva territory.[N]
From what I recall, Count Alva[AN]
has been extorting his people[N]
by levying absurdly high taxes[AN]
and overworking them.[A]
[Left]#Eric 
And since your dear mother[N]
turned them a blind eye,[AN]
you decided to come invest-[N]
igate for yourself. Right?[A]
[MidRight]# Rodin 
Right. That is why we've[N]
come to Alva's lands.[AN]
I'd like to confirm[N]
these claims for myself.[A]

[MoveRight][Right]
Y-Your Highness![N]
Please! Help us![A]
[Left]#Rodin
What is amiss? Please[N]
try to remain calm.[AN]
[Right]#Villager
It's terrible... Bandits are[N]
'ere to plunder our lands[AN]
and take our belongings![N]
Won't you please come drive[AN]
'em away, Your Highness?[A]
[Left]#Rodin
Rest assured. We shall[N]
eradicate those pillagers[AN]
and protect what is[N]
rightfully yours.[A]
[Right] #Villager
Oh, thank you, Your Highness![N]
If there's anythin' I can do to-[AN]
[Left]#Rodin
No need for recompense.[AN]
I am simply doing my duty[N]
as Prince of Novingale.[A]
[Right][MoveFarRight][Right][LoadMichael]
My liege, your[N]
orders, please![A]
[Left]#Rodin
Everyone! Move out, and[N]
protect your fellow[AN]
countrymen from the[N]
bandit attack! Show[AN]
those wretches no mercy![A][X]

[MidLeft]# villager
Thank you! Oh, thank[N]
you so much for[AN]
savin' us from those[N]
ruffians![A]
[MidRight]#Rodin
It sets me at ease knowing[N]
I could intervene in time.[A]
[MidLeft]#villager
If there's anythin' we could[N]
do to return the favor,[AN]
please don't hesitate to give[N]
us a holler, Your Highness![A]
[MidRight]#Rodin
Your well-being is reward[N]
enough for me. That being[AN]
said, something seemed off[N]
about those bandits...[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][LoadMichael]
They were too organized for any[N]
ordinary bandit group, milord.[AN]
If anything, they remind me of[N]
a militia, if an informal one.[A]
[MidRight]#Rodin
Well observed, Michael. Now,[N]
let's take matters to Alva.[AN]
It's high time this madness[N]
was put to a screeching halt.[A]
[MidLeft]#Michael
You've heard the prince,[N]
everybody. Let us be on our way.[A]

#Kelly
What an awful display[N]
that was...[A]
[MidLeft]# Qua
I agree. Though I[N]
don't think there's[AN]
much we can do[N]
against it.[A]
[MidRight]#Kelly
I know Lord Rodin is[N]
counting on us. I[AN]
know we're valuable[N]
to him. Still, seeing[AN]
all that bloodshed[N]
makes me wonder[AN]
just how often this[N]
has happened.[A]
[MidLeft]#Qua 
It'd be so much more convenient[N]
if people didn't have to claw[AN]
at each other. Oh, well...[N]
Let's join the others, Kelly.[A]
