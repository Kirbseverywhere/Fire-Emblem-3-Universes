## RL2Narration
Having subdued the bandit attack in[N]
Alva territory, Rodin finds the[AN]
situation rather suspicious. To[N]
that end, he continues his[AN]
investigation, which takes him[N]
to Count Alva's castle. Hoping[AN]
to find an explanation, Rodin[N]
proceeds inside, unaware of[AN]
what is about to befall him...[A][X]

## RL2OpeningApproach
#(Outside, before the castle)
[MidRight][LoadRodin]
Rrrgh...[A]
[Left][LoadKelly]
Is something the matter,[N]
Your Highness?[A]
[MidRight]#Rodin
I've never liked this place. As[N]
a child, I used to accompany[AN]
my mother on noble visits. That[N]
Alva has always looked down on[AN]
me for whatever reason.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadMichael]
My liege, may I suggest we[N]
approach with due caution?[AN]
You are wary of Count Alva,[N]
after all.[A]
[MidRight]#Rodin
You took the words right[N]
out of my mouth, Michael.[A]
[Left][ClearFace][LoadEric]
Hey, Boss. I think I see[N]
someone coming our way.[AN]
Best be on your guard.[A]
[MidRight]
Hm? Ah, I see them. Brace[N]
yourselves, in any case.[A][X]


## RL2OpeningAugustus
[MidLeft][LoadAugustus][MidRight][LoadMichael]
[MidLeft]#Augustus
Hello.[A]
[MidRight]#Michael
State your name[N]
and purpose.[A]
[MidLeft]#Gus
Oh, I'm Augustus. Call me[N]
Gus if you wish. Reason[AN]
why I am here is because[N]
I saw the commotion earlier[AN]
and decided to have a[N]
look-see for myself.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace][LoadRodin]
Gus, you say? We are about[N]
to enter Count Alva's castle[AN]
in the hopes of knowing what[N]
is going on here.[A]
[MidLeft]#Gus
Oh, I can help. There's[N]
a catch, though.[AN]
[MidRight]#Rodin
Yes? I am all ears.[A]
[MidLeft]#Gus
You're a prince, right?[N]
Means you're quite wealthy.[AN]
I'll help you out, but on[N]
the condition that I'm[AN]
compensated for my efforts.[N]
I'm not too shabby with[AN]
my healing magic.[A]
[MidRight]#R
As you wish. After all,[N]
my companions deserve to[AN]
be rewarded adequately[N]
for their hard efforts.[A]
[MidLeft]
Thanks! Uh...[A]
[MidRight]
You are free to call me Rodin.[N]
My station does not matter[AN]
when we fight as equals. It is[N]
great to meet you, in any case.[A]
[MidLeft]
A pleasure to work[N]
with you then.[A]
[MidRight]
Right. Everyone,[N]
we move![A][X]


## RL2OpeningCastleEntrance
[MidRight][LoadRodin]
[FarLeft][LoadKaiden]
[Left][LoadJonathen]
We've made it. Still, looks[N]
like we're not being met[AN]
with a warm welcome, milord...[AN]
[MidRight]#Rodin
Of all the...![N]
Rrrgh... I fear we find[AN]
ourselves in a deadlock,[N]
my friends. I apologize.[A]
[FarLeft]#Kaiden
What to do now, Lord Rodin?[N]
Break through the enemy lines?[A]
[MidRight]
Mm. After that, we will[N]
churn all the answers out[AN]
of Alva. After all, there[N]
is much I need to know.[A]
[FarLeft]#K
Doesn't look like things will[N]
be all that simple, though...[AN]
[MidRight]#R
I know you won't let me down.[N]
We shall break through![A][X]

#==(SHIFT TO ALVA)==

[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x6A][0x01]#goon
[MidRight][LoadAlva]#Alva
Hmhmhm...[AN]
Sounds like the little brat got[N]
himself tangled up in the web![A]
[MidLeft]
Lord Alva, your orders![A]
[MidRight]
If the brat and his retinue march[N]
on, beat them down! Kill his[AN]
friends, and capture the prince![N]
After all, little boys should[AN]
be returned to their mothers...[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes, milord![A]
[MidRight]
Squirm all you want, Rodin.[N]
Your last breath draws near![AN]
Ah, how sad, and yet,[N]
what a relief...[A][X]

## RL2AfterPrepRodin
[MidLeft][LoadRodin][MidRight][LoadAugustus]
Say, Rodin. I can[N]
hear something.[A]
[MidLeft]
...As can I, now that you mention[N]
it. People screaming for help.[A]
[MidRight]
You gonna help[N]
them, or?[A]
[MidLeft]
Of course. I will not allow[N]
my countrymen to suffocate[AN]
under the yoke of abusive[N]
nobles. We have to be quick,[AN]
or Alva's forces may catch up...[A][X]


## TalkHostage1
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x61][0x01]
Oh, goodness me, I didn't think[N]
I'd make it out alive! Thanks[AN]
so much! Ya saved me hide, ye[N]
kindly folks...[A][X]
## DeathHostage1
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x61][0x01]
No, no, no! Have mercy,[N]
please! Aaaagh...![A][X]

## TalkHostage2
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x5D][0x01]
I'd given up all hope on[N]
being rescued. Then you come[AN]
along and whisk me out.[N]
I owe you my life.[A][X]
## DeathHostage2
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x5D][0x01]
...I feared as much...[N]
So this is the end of it...[A][X]

## RL2EndingAlvaFight
[MidLeft][LoadRodin]
[MidRight][LoadAlva]#Alva
[MidLeft]
Alright, you will speak up.[A]
[MidRight]
I have nothing to say to you![N]
In fact, I could tell your[AN]
mother that-[......]
#Rodin: (move to right; slamming Alva into the wall)
[MidLeft][MoveRight][MidRight][MoveFarFarRight][FarFarRight][MoveFarRight][Right]
Have I not made myself clear?[N]
You will speak up, wretch.[AN]
Those bandits were too[N]
calculating for anyone's good.[AN]
What are you hiding?[A]
[FarRight]
They... they're at my command![N]
I pay them for their services![AN]
[Right]
So rather than look after your[N]
people, as any proper noble should,[AN]
you leave them to their fates to[N]
enrich a conscripted bunch of crooks?[AN]
[FarRight]
What do the lives of those serfs[N]
matter in the grand scheme? Nothing,[AN]
I tell you! They exist to serve us![N]
To enrich us![A]
#Rodin: (slams Alva again)
[Right][MoveMidRight][FarRight][MoveFarFarRight][MidRight][MoveLeft]
[FarFarRight]
Aaaagh![N]
Y-you're breaking my bones![A]
[MoveFarRight]
[Left]
Craven wretch! I have had[N]
enough of you! BEGONE![A]
#(cutting SFX)
[FarRight]
A-ack...![N]
Y-you'll... pay...[A]

[MidRight][LoadKelly]
[FarLeft]
Hey, Kelly? You okay?[A]
[MidRight]
...I'm fine. I'm just not good[N]
with blood, is all.[A]
[FarLeft]
Don't worry. Honestly, I didn't[N]
know Lord Rodin could be so[AN]
vicious around his foes... That[N]
is some strong hatred, alright.[A]
[Left]
Hmm. Kelly, I got an idea.[A]
[MidRight]
Yes? Please tell me.[A]
[Left]
How about we prepare a meal[N]
for everyone once this is[AN]
sorted out? It'll help ease[N]
the tension in all of us.[A]
[MidRight]
That's a great idea. We'll[N]
have to make quite a lot,[AN]
but it'll all bring us[N]
closer together.[A]
[Left]
Yeah, I didn't expect for[N]
things to turn out like this,[AN]
but a victory is a victory[N]
and a celebration is needed.[A][X]

## RL2EndingEric
[MidLeft][LoadEric]
[MidRight][LoadRodin]
Apologies for taking long, everyone.[N]
I know all I need to know now.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You made quite a mess[N]
in there, Boss.[A]
[MidRight]
Yes... I suppose I got[N]
carried away. But victory[AN]
is ours, and the people of[N]
this territory are now free.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I guess that's a win.[N]
Are we bound for the palace?[A]
[MidRight]
That we are. Let us away, my friends.[N]
Today has been a long day.[A][X]
