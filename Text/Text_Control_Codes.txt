Using the position a character is already in as a destination causes them to "bounce". Using a destination that already has a character filling it will cause the characters to switch places. Also, notice the simililarities between the movement types and the "[Open]" commands. Note that there is a 4 character limit for conversations - clear one before loading a fifth each time.
