## GuideStrMagName
Str/Mag Split[X]

## GuideStrMagDesc
Tale of Ternon includes the[N]
Strength and Magic Split.[N]
This means all units have[N]
both strength and magic,[N]
with physical and magical[N]
attacks being powered up[N]
respectively. This ensures[N]
hybrid units work correctly.[X]

## GuideReasonFaithName
Reason and Faith[X]

## GuideReasonFaithDesc
Rather than use traditional[N]
tomes and staves, Tale of[N]
Ternon uses traditional[N]
tomes and staves, but with[N]
the Three Houses names to[N]
look more unique. We hope[N]
to implement actual Three[N]
Houses magic in the future.[N]
Reason magic = Anima and Dark.[N]
Faith magic = Light and Staff.[X]

## GuideSkillSystemName
Skill System[X]

## GuideSkillSystemDesc
The Circleseverywhere Skill[N]
System is included in Tale of[N]
Ternon. Each unit has a unique[N]
skill, and may have an additional[N]
skill tied to their class.[N]
No skills are gained by level.[X]

## GuideAccessoriesName
Accessories[X]

## GuideAccessoriesDesc
Like in Three Houses, units in[N]
Tale of Ternon may equip one[N]
accessory. These bring a range[N]
of benefits and drawbacks to[N]
the unit. For example, the Shield[N]
increases defence by 4, but also[N]
lowers speed by 4. Classes such[N]
as Armour Knights would like it.[X]

## GuideUnitColorName
Unit Color[X]

## GuideUnitColorDesc
The three routes of Tale of[N]
Ternon each have their own[N]
banner and colours. In order[N]
to immerse the player in the[N]
experience, these colours are[N]
represented on the map.[N]
Red: Crimson Wolves[N]
Purple: Purple Jaguars[N]
Yellow: Amber Bears, Neutral[N]
Black: Enemy[N]
[N]
Some people dislike colours[N]
being changed from their[N]
traditional positions. Setting[N]
Unit Colour to Off restores[N]
the series's traditional[N]
colour scheme.[N]
Blue = Player[N]
Red = Enemy[N]
Green = Neutral[N]
[X]

## GuideHpBarsName
HP Bars[X]

## GuideHpBarsDesc
Health bars are used to[N]
show a units health at a[N]
quick glance. This is[N]
a common source of lag on[N]
larger maps, however.[N]
In such circumstances,[N]
disabling the bars may[N]
improve performance.[X]
